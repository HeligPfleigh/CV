  %%% Overview

  \noindent\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
    I'm an experienced fullstack developer who interested in building reusable, well-constructed websites and applications
    (included 5 years working with React/React Native). \newline
    
    I really enjoy designing and implementing simple solutions to complex problems. 
    I could rapidly identify the essential dynamics, invent a remedy, monitor, and iterate solutions 
    that deliver results in long run when encounter a problem. \newline

    I always interested in continuation of learning and could be considered a team-player as I like to help other and tend 
    to work well within the group. I can also do some mentoring tasks and do code reviews for other team members. \newline
